# 🚗 Latest Car News Web App

As part of my learning journey in **web development**, I built a **responsive web app** that displays the latest **car news** using a public **Car News API**.  
The app fetches news articles dynamically using **AJAX**, and displays them in a clean, responsive layout powered by **Bootstrap**.
